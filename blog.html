    <h3>1. Discribe difference between Local Storage and Session Storage?</h3>
    <p>Their main difference is that local storage data does not expire, whereas session       storage data gets cleared when the user closes its browser window.
    Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time. So, if a user has three tabs open, each one will have its own page session.
    Since local storage is not session-based, all the data must be deleted via javascript or manually.</p>

    <h3>2. Discribe difference between Global scope and Block scope ?</h3>
    <p>In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node. js, it's controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for statements, and the like.</p>

    <h3>3. How does JavaScript event loop work?</h3>
    <p>The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
    
    <h3>4. How can we get undefined in javascript?</h3>
    <p>A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined . A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned .</p>
